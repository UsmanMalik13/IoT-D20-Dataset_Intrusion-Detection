## Introduction

This report evaluates the performance of different machine learning models in classifying IDS attacks. It provides insights into the project’s implementation process, results, challenges faced, and potential improvements to enhance detection accuracy.

---

## Overview of the Project

The primary objective of this project is to create machine learning models that can reliably distinguish between malicious and legitimate network traffic. This involves several stages:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and formatting network traffic data for model readiness.
2. **Feature Selection**: Identifying significant features to improve model performance.
3. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Implementing various classification algorithms and comparing their performance.

---

## Implementation Steps

### Data Preprocessing

To prepare the raw network traffic data for machine learning models, we cleaned and structured it to remove noise and inconsistencies. This step ensures the data is in a usable form that models can effectively interpret.

### Feature Selection

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to identify the most relevant features for classification, reducing data dimensionality while retaining essential information. This process enhances the models' prediction accuracy by focusing on the most significant features.

### Model Training

Multiple machine learning models were trained to determine the most effective approach for IDS attack classification. Each model was evaluated to measure its accuracy, precision, and overall performance.

## Machine Learning Models Used

The following models were implemented for classification:

1. **Logistic Regression**: A simple yet effective model for binary classification.
2. **Random Forest**: A model that uses multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.
3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: A model that finds the optimal boundary between classes for better separation.
4. **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**: A model that bases predictions on the nearest data points in the feature space.
5. **Neural Network**: A deep learning model that mimics the human brain’s ability to learn from complex data.
6. **Gradient Boosting**: A model that combines multiple weak models to create stronger predictive power.
7. **Graph Neural Networks (GCN and GIN)**: Advanced models suited for data structured as graphs, capturing complex relationships between data points.

---

## Results and Evaluation

Each model was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results indicate that some models are better suited for IDS attack classification than others, with advanced models like Neural Networks and Graph Neural Networks showing promise in capturing complex patterns in the data.

## Challenges and Future Improvements

### Challenges
- **Data Imbalance**: The dataset showed an imbalance between malicious and legitimate traffic, affecting model performance.
- **Feature Engineering**: Selecting the right features was challenging due to the complex nature of network data.

### Future Improvements
- **Data Augmentation**: Additional data generation methods can help balance the dataset.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing model parameters to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.
- **Ensemble Learning**: Combining multiple models to improve classification performance.

## Conclusion

The IDS Attack Classification project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in enhancing cybersecurity through accurate attack detection. With further optimizations, these models can be deployed to improve the reliability and security of network systems.
